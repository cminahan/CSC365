The tables are uic, education, and employment. The education table outlines the population of people in various areas in California that
are educated and the different degrees to which they have completed. The uic data is about the overall population of each of the listed
counties. And the employment data states the unemployment rates of each county. They all show the different areas in California and how
their population, education, and unemployment throughout the years are all related. 

Challenges that I encountered was that there were so many columns to and different data points so I decided to condense it to California to
make it easier to read and comprehend.
